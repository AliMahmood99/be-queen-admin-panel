## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current Mock Data Limitations
1. **Booking/Order History:** Uses placeholder data (same for all users)
   - Will be replaced when backend is ready
   - Shows structure and UI correctly

2. **Status Updates:** Don't persist after page refresh
   - By design for demo purposes
   - Real API will persist changes

3. **CSV Export:** Works but data is simplified
   - Real export will have more fields
